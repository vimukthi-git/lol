It can,

- Keep localizations for your applications in one place, so that everyone in your team(dev, QA, BA) can contribute in localizing your application.
- Because of couchdb it has a flexible schema that can be adapted to manage any number of languages.
- add, edit localization strings, languages etc. easily.
- Support replication to any number of couchdb nodes so that every one can test localizations in locally in their own machines before committing to central server.
